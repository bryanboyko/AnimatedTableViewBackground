#Overview
An app called Transit had a very nice method for integrating a tableview with a mapview on the same screen.  Only a few cells of the tableview are visible below a mapview, but they can be dragged upwards to cover the map and reveal the rest of the table.  I recreated this effect here with a background image, which can be easily swapped out with another view.

#Preview
Its hard to see in the .gif, but the gray area moving from the bottom is the tableview.
